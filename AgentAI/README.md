# AgentAI

This folder contains the core logic and components for the AI agents that power MedBotAssist. These agents are responsible for managing natural language interactions, maintaining conversational context, and executing workflows related to appointment scheduling and clinical documentation.

## Contents
- Prompt templates, role definitions, and behavioral settings for each agent.
- Custom tools and functions used by the agents to interact with external systems (e.g., EHRs, scheduling APIs).
- Modular conversational flows and task-specific logic built using frameworks like LangChain or Semantic Kernel.
- Context management and memory persistence strategies for maintaining continuity across sessions.
- Unit and integration tests to validate agent behavior and response accuracy.
